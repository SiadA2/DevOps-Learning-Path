## Configuration files

### What are configuration files?

Configuration files are files in an Operating System which contain your hardcoded settings. It's best to not touch these unless you know how they work and it's absolutely necessary as you don't want any uninteded damage to your machine. 

### Where are the configuration files stored in Linux?

Everything config-related in Linux is stored in the file ~/.bashrc. If ZSH is our default shell, then it will be stored in the ~/.zshrc file instead. We can edit this file to set things such as aliases and environment variables, which can make our work far more efficient. If you already know what aliases and environment variables are, great! If not, then no worries! We'll cover this later on in this repo.

Now that we've looked at a real example of a file in Linux, let's look at how we can edit files!
