## Linux File System

### What is the Linux file system?

The linux file system basically refers to the way files are laid out in Linux. It follows a hierachical structure, starting with the root directory, which can be identified with a '/'. This is followed by any subdirectories within the root directory, then any subdirectories within those subdirectories, and so on. An example of a Linux file can be seen below:

```/users/user1/folder/file.txt```

Now that you've understood the Linux file system, let's put it to use!
