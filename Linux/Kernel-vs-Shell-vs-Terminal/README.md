## The Kernel vs The Shell vs The Terminal

### What's the Kernel?

The kernel is the core, centremost part of the Operating System. Think of it as the part where all the decisions take place. 

### What's the Shell?

The shell, also known as the terminal in colloquial terms although they aren't the same, is the opposite of the kernel. It sits on the outer layer, taking input from the user and translating it into instructions the kernel can understand.

### How we communicate with the Shell?

We do this via the terminal, which I've already made brief mention of. This is a user-facing, command-line interface where we input commands that can be digested by the shell.

### What's Linux's shell?

The shell for Linux is BASH, abbreviated from 'Bourne-Again Shell'. However, other shells can be used, such as ZSH, which are similar, but I'll get into more depth regarding that further on. Bash features several commands that we can input to the terminal, which allow us to create, delete, move, rename and edit files and directories. The type of shell an Operating System has determines how we communicate with the Operating System. Think of it like countries and languages - Different countries have different languages that the people communicate with.

I'll touch upon some of these on the next page.
