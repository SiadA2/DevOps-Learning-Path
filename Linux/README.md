## All things Linux

Hi everyone! In this folder, I will do a brief rundown of Linux, heavily focusing on navigating the Command-Line/Terminal. It's currently based on what I've learnt so far, so there will be some concepts that haven't been covered yet. However, anybody is free to have a read, whether your a beginner looking to get hands-on with Linux, an experienced professional looking to refresh their foundational knowledge, or just someone following my journey!

Before you dive right into it, I would recommend you have this page open in a separate window:

[Basic Linux Commands](https://github.com/SiadA2/DevOps-Learning-Path/tree/main/Linux/Basic-Commands)

This is a page containing some of the first commands you'll use as you go through the folder. Don't worry; you don't need to know anything for now. Think of this as a Linux piggy bank which you can top up with extra commands as you read through each topic and use at will.

The structure to this folder is as follows:
