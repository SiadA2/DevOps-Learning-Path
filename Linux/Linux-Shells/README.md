## More about Linux Shells

### Linux Shells

As mentioned before, Linux has several shells that you can use to communicate to the Operating System with. Some examples include ZSH, KSH and fish. Whichever one you prefer to use is entirely up to you and your needs, however, for beginners, bash is highly recommended as it's the most common of them. However, it's still possible to change between shells. I'll quickly run through a pretty short and simple tutorial showing you how you can install zsh and run it as a shell.

### Tutorial: Installing ZSH

Step 1: pass ```sudo apt-get install zsh``` into your terminal, and wait for the installation to finish.

Step 2: pass ```zsh``` to switch to ZSH anytime you want

Step 3: To set ZSH as your default shell, pass ```chsh -s /bin/zsh```, and close your terminal, then reopen it. Your terminal should open with your ZSH shell up and running.

NOTE: This method works for any other suitable shell on Linux that you would want to use.

Now, let's have a look at the Linux file system
