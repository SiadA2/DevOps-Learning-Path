# DevOps-Learning-Path

HiðŸ‘‹! This repo shows my journey learning DevOps, as well as hands-on exercises and projects that I've done to go from Zero to Hero in the space. 

If you want to see the journey that I took from start to finish, then I'd recommend reading the files in this order:

## [Linux](https://github.com/SiadA2/DevOps-Learning-Path/tree/main/Linux/Basic-Commands) 

- Here, I mostly focused on the Linux fundamentals, more specifically honing in on terminal fluency as it's the most vital skill to have when navigating through DevOps tools.
- You'll see things such as basic commands, aliases and the Linux file system.
- At the end of this topic, you can try out your terminal & troubleshooting skills by trying out the the OverTheWire Bandit game which I've linked at the bottom of that section, using my solutions as help along the way.

## [Scripting](https://github.com/SiadA2/DevOps-Learning-Path/tree/main/Linux/Basic-Commands)

- Here you'll see me go into the logic of a scripting language, which in this case is Bash. However, I do plan on adding other scripting languages such as python to widen my variety of possibles methods of scripting. 
- This part contains universal scripting logic, such as variables, loops, string and conditional statements.
- At the end of this topic, I've attemped a challenging scripting game to enhance problem solving and to solidify my fluency in Bash syntax.

## [Git](https://github.com/SiadA2/DevOps-Learning-Path/tree/main/Linux/Basic-Commands)

- Here, I jump into the basics of version control, starting with an intro of what it is and how it's evolved over the year.
- Then I jump into Git/GitHub, showing how to use it to properly download, edit and save code. 
- However, there isn't a activity at the end, so I'd recommend you play around with all the git commands on a VM, or an environment like killacoda. Don't be afraid of breaking things, it's part of the process.

## [Networking](https://github.com/SiadA2/DevOps-Learning-Path/tree/main/Linux/Basic-Commands)

- Here, I dive into everything networking-related, breaking down how resources communicate with each other. Things covered include the OSI model, IP Addressing, Subnetting and different protocols such as TCP/UDP.
- At the end of this topic, I deployed an NGINX webserver on Amazon EC2. This reinforced networking concepts specific to the cloud, such as security groups, routing .etc. If you want to an exercise, it can be any of your choice. For example, creating an EC2 and restricing access through NACLs and security groups.

## [Docker](https://github.com/SiadA2/DevOps-Learning-Path/tree/main/Linux/Basic-Commands)

- Here, I breakdown the concept of containerisation and it's importance in making applications lightweight, reusable and resource & cost-efficient.
- I delve into Docker, the most common containerisation tool and explain the basic components, such as Dockerfiles, Docker networks and Docker-compose.
- At the end of this topic, I deployed a multi-container app using the skills that I learnt. Again, what you deploy is completely up to you, have a read of the [Docker Hub documentation](https://hub.docker.com/) to see what kind of app you would want to run, and try it out!

## [Cloud](https://github.com/SiadA2/DevOps-Learning-Path/tree/main/Linux/Basic-Commands)

- Here, I introduce you to cloud, and what it is, including some information on the state of the current-day Cloud market. I look into things such as the market size, it's projected growth and the market share of the top cloud providers. It was this information that I evaluated to help inform my decision making on which cloud provider I choose to master.
- The cloud provider of choice for this topic is AWS. I delve into some of the most common AWS services that you'll come across, such as IAM, S3, EC2 .etc. 
- At the end, I used what I learnt to create basic architecture in the cloud. Although mine was somewhat basic, I'd highly recommend you build what is known as the "Three-tier Archetecture". If you're not sure, no problem. Feel free to research and Google what you need. 

## [IaC](https://github.com/SiadA2/DevOps-Learning-Path/tree/main/Linux/Basic-Commands)

- Here, I explain away Infrastructure as Code, what it is, and how we can use it to provision our cloud infrastructure. 
- I go through Terraform, an example of an IaC tool. I show you core concepts of the tool, as well as a range of commands that we can manipulate to create and decomission infrastructure in line with best-practices.
- At the end of this topic, I hosted WordPress on the cloud, provisioning my infrastructure using Terraform.
