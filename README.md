# DevOps-Learning-Path

HiðŸ‘‹! This repo shows my journey learning DevOps, as well as hands-on exercises and projects that I've done to go from Zero to Hero in the space. 

If you want to see the journey that I took from start to finish, then I'd recommend reading the files in this order:

## [Linux](https://github.com/SiadA2/DevOps-Learning-Path/tree/main/Linux/Basic-Commands) 

- Here, I mostly focused on the Linux fundamentals, more specifically honing in on terminal fluency as it's the most vital skill to have when navigating through DevOps tools.
- You'll see things such as basic commands, aliases and the Linux file system.
- At the end of this topic, you can try out your terminal & troubleshooting skills by trying out the the OverTheWire Bandit game which I've linked at the bottom of that section, using my solutions as help along the way.

## [Scripting](https://github.com/SiadA2/DevOps-Learning-Path/tree/main/Linux/Basic-Commands)

- Here you'll see me go into the logic of a scripting language, which in this case is Bash. However, I do plan on adding other scripting languages such as python to widen my variety of possibles methods of scripting. 
- This part contains universal scripting logic, such as variables, loops, string and conditional statements.
- At the end of this topic, I've attemped a challenging scripting game to enhance problem solving and to solidify my fluency in Bash syntax.

## [Git](https://github.com/SiadA2/DevOps-Learning-Path/tree/main/Linux/Basic-Commands)

- Here, I jump into the basics of version control, starting with an intro of what it is and how it's evolved over the year.
- Then I jump into Git/GitHub, showing how to use it to properly download, edit and save code. 
- However, there isn't a activity at the end, so I'd recommend you play around with all the git commands on a VM, or an environment like killacoda. Don't be afraid of breaking things, it's part of the process.

## [Networking](https://github.com/SiadA2/DevOps-Learning-Path/tree/main/Linux/Basic-Commands)

- Here, I dive into everything networking-related, breaking down how resources communicate with each other. Things covered include the OSI model, IP Addressing, Subnetting and different protocols such as TCP/UDP.
- At the end of this topic, I deployed an NGINX webserver on Amazon EC2. This reinforced networking concepts specific to the cloud, such as security groups, routing .etc. If you want to an exercise, it can be any of your choice. For example, creating an EC2 and restricing access through NACLs and security groups.
